## Table S2. Deployment metadata template 

Deployment information including instrument settings, organism metadata, and tagging procedures. The Deployment metadata template is to be completed by the researcher and uploaded to a compliant repository alongside the data, as well as the Device metadata template provided by the manufacturer. All attributes are mandatory, but fields can be “unknown” or “NA” if data do not exist or are not applicable. Organism weight can be measured at instrument deployment and remeasured once if applicable; up to three size measurement fields can be reported  (e.g. for a shark: pre-caudal length, fork length, total length; for a pinniped: standard length, curve length, axillary girth; for a turtle: curved carapace length).
